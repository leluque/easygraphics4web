# EasyGraphics4Web

[![MIT License][license-image]][license]

EasyGraphics4Web is a client-side Typescript library designed to make it easier and more flexible the manipulation of geometric shapes, text, and connection paths. The main reason for its creation was the preparation of a structure that could be used in libraries for the representation and manipulation of diagrams.

## Features
 * It must provide a layer that is independent of the drawing library (e.g. SVG.js, Snap.svg, Paper.js) and technology (e.g. SVG, canvas) used;
 * It must support drawing, manipulating, and animating shapes/text, as well as attaching events to them;
 * It must implement different layouts, allowing automatic organization of shapes/text (e.g. horizontal and vertical linear layouts);
 * It must support different look-and-feels
